GuardLink is a RP toolkit and "nation" simulator providing various systems for accounts, economies, laws and more. Everything happens on a centralized server and players interact with the systems via pocket computers. Admins will be able to manage the systems through an interface on the computer or remotely through their account. Each server simulates a country/nation/empire with features such as:

- Accounts & Identities (done)
- Wallets & Currencies (done)
- Properties & Real Estate
- Companies & Jobs
- Interactions between other computers (trade, diplomacy, currency exchange etc)
- Setup wizard (done)

Some features do not work with every government type/ethic.
